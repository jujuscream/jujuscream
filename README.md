Hello,
I am JuJuScream
I am joining github mostly to learn, however I will share what I know if I think it would help someone.



I will list topics that I have some knowledge on and if you have any questions for me you can quickly scan the list to see if I will be of any help.

Kali Linux -I have a little know-how about this OS although I am still fairly new to it. Shit though, couldn't hurt to ask me your question. I'll try my best to help.

Windows -This is the OS I grew up on. I know a lot about Windows. Probably, I can offer some good solutions to Windows problems.

Arduino - I've done my share of Arduino projects. 

I'm not going to write out my whole thing right now because I am in the middle of a problem, I'll finish this later.
